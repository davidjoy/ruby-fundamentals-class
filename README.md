# What is this curriculum

## Philosophy
### Less is More
Strip everything that isn't strictly necessary to learn the concept.

### Small Wins
Break large exercises into small components.  Provide explicit steps and milestones.

### Don't D.R.Y. the code
Best coding practices usually make code more abstract.  Abstraction is hard to follow for new students.  Prefer duplication.

### [5 Whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys)
When a student is confused, drive to the core of the confusion.  The [5 whys technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) is helpful to identify the core confusions.
