# What is this curriculum

- Weekly Scripts for students
- One off guides
- Example code




## Philosophy
### Less is More
Strip everything that isn't strictly necessary to learn the concept.

### Small Wins
Break large exercises into small components.  Provide explicit steps and milestones.

### Don't D.R.Y. the code
Best coding practices usually make code more abstract.  Abstraction is hard to follow for new students.  Prefer duplication.

### [5 Whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys)
When a student is confused, drive to the core of the confusion.  The [5 whys technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) is helpful to identify the core confusions.




## Guide to making changes


### Converting to student versions
1) Copy the [script directory](https://github.com/toppy42/ruby-fundamentals-class/tree/master/weekly_scripts) to the [student scripts directory](https://github.com/toppy42/ruby-fundamentals-class/tree/master/weekly_scripts_scripts_student_version)  
2) Search and remove all Answers. This is currently done via Sublime regex search: `# Answer(.|\n)*?# /Answer`

![Sublime Search Replace](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s358/sh/86da6f33-9b13-4206-8086-d9d40179e697/7cb290d9d7b1e7c1/res/eb3b32c6-647e-44fb-a9da-8d93e711b04b/skitch.png)
